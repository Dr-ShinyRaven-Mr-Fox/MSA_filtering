# MSA_filtering

This program allows to filter a nucleotide alignment obtained by transposing protein MSAs and performed using GUIDANCE. There are two options: filter nucleotide MSAs using the GUIDANCE results and remove gaps in MSAs. WARNING: this program needs python3 and biopython to be installed (pip install biopython)

To install the program either copy the python script and call it with 'python cdsMSAfilter_guidance.py -h' or install with pip install "git+https://github.com/Dr-ShinyRaven-Mr-Fox/MSA_filtering.git" and run it as such: 'cdsMSAfilter_guidance -h'
